## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- An Anvil instance running locally (or another compatible Ethereum node)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiKiranMatta/anvil-ui
cd anvil-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```

3. Configure the environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set your RPC URL if different from the default:
```
VITE_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Development

### Adding New Methods

To add new Anvil methods, modify `lib/anvil-methods.ts`. Each method requires:

```typescript
methodName: {
  name: 'Display Name',
  method: async (params) => {
    // Implementation
  },
  params: [
    { name: 'paramName', type: 'string', placeholder: 'Parameter description' }
  ],
  description: 'Method description'
}
```
